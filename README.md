Generating text using Markov chains (I'm not really smart enough for markov chains but I'm doing something similar)

## What is it?
This program generates text based on the text that you give it. If you were to give it a transcript of a speech by Donald Trump, it would spit something back at you that *sounded like* Mr Trump, but would read like nonsense. In fact, anything produced by this program is nonsense.

## How do I use it?
Paste whatever text you want to "mimic" into the top text box, hit the button and enjoy the output.

## Why would I use it?
I don't know. It's a bit of a laugh I guess.
